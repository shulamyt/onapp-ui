# configurable-ui
React devs using JSX. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar and a decleretive way for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).
We love JSX, no mistake! But our products are enterprise products that are built on a confirurable model with multiple layers. We do not purport to offer a new engine or heavy mapper. We just want to connect React with Json model that can easy to extends in layers, stringifay and send in network fir dynamic purposes.

React refer to some terser syntax like: [react-hyperscript](https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript) and [hyperscript-helpers](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
